## bp (base pair)
A base pair (bp) is a unit of measurement in genetics that refers to two nucleotides on opposite complementary DNA or RNA strands that are connected via hydrogen bonds. Base pairs are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, and they are typically represented by the letters A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine), and G (guanine). For example, A pairs with T, and C pairs with G.

## TSS (Transcription Start Site)
The Transcription Start Site (TSS) is the specific location in the DNA where transcription of a gene begins, meaning it's the point where RNA polymerase starts synthesizing RNA from the DNA template. In genomic coordinates, the TSS is usually labeled as position 0.

## Genomic Coordinates
Genomic coordinates are a system used to specify the location of genes, regulatory elements, and other features on a genome. They are typically represented as a combination of chromosome number, start position, and end position. For example, "chr1:1000-2000" indicates that the feature is located on chromosome 1, starting at position 1000 and ending at position 2000.

## TATA
Refers to a promoter that contains a TATA box, a specific DNA sequence (TATAAA) found about 25-35 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. The TATA box helps position RNA polymerase for transcription initiation.

## no-TATA
Refers to promoters that lack a TATA box. These promoters use other sequences and mechanisms to initiate transcription.

## RNA polymerase
RNA polymerase is an enzyme responsible for synthesizing RNA from a DNA template during the process of transcription. It binds to the promoter region of a gene and unwinds the DNA to create a transcription bubble, allowing RNA synthesis to occur.

## Promoter
The **promoter** is a broad region of DNA located upstream of a gene that regulates the initiation of transcription. It contains various DNA elements that are recognized by RNA polymerase and transcription factors. Promoters can be classified into different types, such as TATA and no-TATA, based on the presence or absence of specific elements.

The **core promoter** is a specific, smaller region within the promoter (usually about 40–60 base pairs surrounding the transcription start site) that is essential for the assembly of the transcription machinery and the initiation of transcription. The core promoter typically includes elements like the TATA box, Initiator (Inr), and others.

**In summary:**

- **Promoter:** The entire regulatory region upstream of a gene, which may include the core promoter and additional regulatory elements (such as enhancers, silencers, and proximal promoter elements).
- **Core promoter:** The minimal DNA sequence required for accurate transcription initiation, located at or near the transcription start site.

## DNA Directionality (5′ to 3′)
DNA has two strands, and each has a direction. One end is called 5′ (five prime) and the other 3′ (three prime).
The two strands run in opposite directions: one goes 5′ to 3′, and the other goes 3′ to 5′.
This is important because the cell reads and copies DNA only from 5′ to 3′.
